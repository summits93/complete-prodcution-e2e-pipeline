To propose changes to a file using the GitHub API, you would typically use the "Create a pull request" endpoint. Here's a basic example:

1. **Get the SHA of the branch**: You need to get the SHA of the branch you're proposing changes to. You can do this using the "Get a reference" endpoint.

2. **Get the content of the file**: You need to fetch the content of the file you want to propose changes to. You can do this using the "Get contents" endpoint.

3. **Make changes to the file**: Modify the content of the file as needed.

4. **Create a new branch**: If you're not working on a branch already, you might need to create a new branch using the "Create a reference" endpoint.

5. **Commit changes to the new branch**: Commit the changes to the new branch using the "Create a commit" endpoint.

6. **Create a pull request**: Finally, create a pull request to propose your changes using the "Create a pull request" endpoint.

Here's a basic example using cURL:

```bash
# Step 1: Get the SHA of the branch
SHA=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN" https://api.github.com/repos/:owner/:repo/git/ref/heads/:branch | jq -r '.object.sha')

# Step 2: Get the content of the file
CONTENT=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN" https://api.github.com/repos/:owner/:repo/contents/:path/to/file | jq -r '.content')

# Step 3: Make changes to the file
# For example, modify the content using your preferred method

# Step 4: Create a new branch (if needed)
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"ref":"refs/heads/new-branch-name","sha":"'${SHA}'"}' \
  https://api.github.com/repos/:owner/:repo/git/refs

# Step 5: Commit changes to the new branch
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"message":"Commit message","content":"'${CONTENT}'","branch":"new-branch-name"}' \
  https://api.github.com/repos/:owner/:repo/git/commits

# Step 6: Create a pull request
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"title":"Pull request title","head":"new-branch-name","base":"target-branch-name"}' \
  https://api.github.com/repos/:owner/:repo/pulls
```

Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN`, `:owner`, `:repo`, `:branch`, `:path/to/file`, `new-branch-name`, `Commit message`, and `Pull request title` with your own information.
